            Hi, I’m Valerio Ferretti! I’m a passionate software
            engineer with a strong background in backend
            development and a growing interest in frontend and
            web technologies.
            I am a Linux aficionado and have been playing
            with Linux distros, window managers, and desktop
            environments for many years, finally settling on
            <a style="color: #212529; font-weight: 700;" href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/">KDE Plasma</a> on
            <a style="color: #1094D2; font-weight: 700;" href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>.
            I just love the open source philosophy and the
            opportunity to fully own my system, occasionally
            break things 😬 and learn from my mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I live in an alpine region 🏔️ in northern Italy
            and I am very much into mountaineering, hiking,
            trail running and cycling. These activities are
            not just a hobby, they are a challenge and an
            occasion to push my limits, which is something I
            really enjoy. My motto?
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
                Mens sana in corpore sano.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            This blog is a place where I can talk about myself,
            share my thoughts and findings on technology, and
            rumble on best practices. Happy browsing!
